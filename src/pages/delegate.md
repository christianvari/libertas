### Delegate your CRO to Libertas Staking pool

**_If you have your CRO on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 token, you need to migrate them first._** [**_Click here to open the migration guide_**](https://www.libertascrypto.org/blog/migration/ "CRO Migration guide")

At the moment you can only use the desktop application or the CLI to delegate to a community pool. It will also be implemented soon on the Defi Wallet Mobile App.

#### Crypto.org chain Desktop Wallet

First of all we need to download the app for our platform. [Click here to open the download page](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain-desktop-wallet/releases/ "Crypto.orgdesktop wallet download page")

After that we have downloaded the application and created or restored our wallet **( remember to keep your mnemonic phrase in a safe place )**, we can start to delegate our CRO.

We have to select the **Staking** tab

Then select **Delegate funds** tab and put the Libertas Validator Address in the **Validator address** field

Libertas Validator Address is: **crocncl1dayf6c9vycqced70p6cx70334ctafz8j0wp6t2**

Now our funds are delegated on Libertas and we'll start earn interests on our CRO.
